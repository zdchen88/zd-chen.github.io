  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ECED 
    6330.03 : Computational Electromagnetics</strong>.<br>
    This class introduces the theory and applications of numerical techniques 
    employed to solve various electromagnetic structure problems in both time 
    and frequency-domains. Major topics include: review of electromagnetic theory, 
    variational approach, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, transmission 
    line matrix (TLM) method, finite element method (FEM), method of moment (MoM), 
    method of line (MoL) and boundary element method (BEM). Projects include applications 
    of different computational techniques to solve electromagnetic problems.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ECED 
    6324.03 : RF/Microwave System Design for Telecommunications</strong>.<br>
    The class provides essential design techniques for radio/microwave links in 
    telecommunication systems. Major topics include: review of general radio propagation 
    in free space, over obstacles and in the Earth's atmosphere; the design principles 
    of broadband radio/microwave communication links; design and sizing of satellite 
    earth stations; development of hardware configurations for line-of-sight radio 
    links.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ECED 
    6340.03 : Antenna Theory and Design.</strong><br>
    This class deals with the theory and design of antennas. Major topics include: 
    Radiation from wire-type and operative-type antennas, antenna arrays, scanning 
    antennae, signal processing antennae, ground effects on antennas characteristics, 
    design considerations and measurements, and special topics in antenna systems.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ECED 
    6320.03 : Microwave Radio Systems.</strong><br>
    This class deals with both analog and digital microwave radio systems. Major 
    topics include: Devices and circuits for microwave generation, amplification, 
    frequency conversion, modulation and detection techniques, phase-locked loops, 
    microwave propagation characteristics, design considerations of terrestrial 
    and satellite communication systems, and interference problems in microwave 
    radio systems.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://emgroup.ece.dal.ca/eced4301/">ECED 
    4301.03 : Electromagnetic Waves &amp; Propagation</a>.</strong><br>
    This class presents the basic theory and applications of propagation of electromagnetic 
    waves. Major topics include: time-varying Maxwell's equations, electromotive 
    force, electromagnetic spectrum, transmission of plane waves, reflection and 
    refraction, polarization, radiation, transmission line theory, standing wave 
    ratio, Smith Chart, impedance matching, guided wave structures, modes and 
    cut-off frequencies.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ECED 
    3300.03 : Electromagnetic Fields.</strong><br>
    This class forms an introduction to basic electromagnetic principles upon 
    which Electrical Engineering is based. The laws underlying the theory are 
    presented in integral and differential form. A classical development of electrostatics, 
    steady state current, and magnetostatics will lead to Maxwell's equations. 
    The theory developed is applied to calculating circuit parameters such as 
    resistance, capacitance, and inductance for any electronic or magnetic structure.<br>
