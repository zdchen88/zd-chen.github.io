</font></font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general objectives of this research group is</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) to develop new computational electromagnetic modelling methods (e.g., unconditionally stable techniques, unification of numerical emthods), <br> (2) to design innovative RF/microwave circuits/systems and antennas (e.g., wireless sensing and power transfer systems), <br> (3) to research and investigate new electromagnetic phenomena (e.g., bioelectricity and bioelectromagnetics), and <br> (4) to develop new electromagnetic materials and applications (e.g., metasurfances, new engineered materials)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More specifically, we are interested in projects and topics related to bioelectricity, bioelectromagnetics, novel electromagnetic or optical materials/structures, analysis of digital and high-frequency signal integrity, and design of intelligent RF/microwave radio  systems, smart antennas, ultra-wide-band technology, high-frequency electronics  and wireless power transfer and harveting technology.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The laboratory 
  has been successful in attracting a talented group of graduate students and 
  in interacting with talented colleagues. Membership in the laboratory is treated 
  as a privilege and members are expected to exhibit a high degree of self-motivation, 
  independence, and creativity. The work in the laboratory contributes actively 
  to the advancement of both teaching and research in its areas of expertise, 
as can be evidenced from its publications </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
  the moment, we has several active research projects supported by the Natural 
  Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the corporate sector. 
  Although fundamental research is still part of our research activities (as it 
  renders us with long-term vitality), we are actively seeking more and larger 
  contract research projects from industry in the coming years. These opportunities 
  will allow us to continually contribute to the knowledge base and to aid to 
  the healthy development of our economy and technology.</font>
