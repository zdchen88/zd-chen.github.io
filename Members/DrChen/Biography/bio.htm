  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Chen received 
    the B. Eng. degree in Radio Engineering from Fuzhou University, Fujian, P.R. 
    of China, the M. of Appl. Sc. degree in Radio Engineering from Nanjing Institute 
    of Technology (currently Southeast University), Nanjing, P.R. of China, the 
    PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, 
    Canada, respectively. He was a winner of the Association of Professors University 
    of Ottawa Student Award (1990), Ontario Graduate Student Scholarship (1991-1992) 
    and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) 
    Postdoctoral Fellowship (1993).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From January of 
    1993 to August of 1993, he was with Department of Electrical and Computer 
    Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, as a NSERC postdoctoral 
    fellow under the supervision of Professor Peter Silvester. Since September 
    of 1993, he has been on staff with the Faculty of Engineering (formerly the 
    Technical University of Nova Scotia), Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, 
    where he is presently a professor.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Chen has been 
    active in both teaching and research. Right since his first term with Dalhousie 
    University, he has been teaching various undergraduate and graduate courses 
    in the areas of RF/Microwave communication electronics/systems, antennas and 
    electromagnetics (5 courses per year on average), and has maintained good 
    evaluations. He has authored or co-authored over 100 journal/conference 
    papers and industrial reports in the areas of RF/microwave circuit and system 
    design and computational electromagnetics. He was one of the key originators 
    in developing new numerical algorithms a recent scheme, the so-called ADI-FDTD 
    method. He was also involved in designing a new class of compact RF front-end 
    circuits for wireless communications. He was a sole/principal investigator 
    of more than 10 grants from both government and industry, including the recent 
    Atlantic Innovation Fund on smart transceiver (2002-), Canadian NSERC Strategic 
    Grant on novel RF front-end module (1999-), grants from Nortel Networks Ltd. 
    on mm-wave filters (1998-2001) and grants from Orion Electronics Ltd. on low-profile 
    antennas and DSP schemes for direction finding (1998-2001). He has obtained 
    almost three million dollars of research funding. He has completed supervision 
    of 5 postdoctoral fellows, 1 PhD student, 7 M.A.Sc. students and more than 
    40 undergraduate students for their senior projects. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Chen served 
    as an editorial board member for the IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory 
    and Techniques. He is also an invited reviewer for various international journals 
    and research grant agencies. He was an invited speaker, session chair and 
    organizer for a number of international conferences, workshops and seminars. 
    He is a senior member of IEEE, a registered professional engineer and has 
    served as a consultant for a number of local companies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Chen has also 
    been involved in various professional and university administrative activities. 
    He served as the ECE graduate advisor (2002- and 1998-1999), the Acting ECE 
    Co-op advisor (2001-2002), a University Senate Library committee member (2001-2003), 
    a University Scholarship Committee (2001-2002), a University Instructional 
    Development Committee member (1998-1999) and the ECE staff, faculty and head 
    search committee member (1998). He was the Chair of IEEE Atlantic Section 
    and a member of Board of Directors of IEEE Canada (2000-2001). He was also 
    the Chairman of the Board of Director for Halifax Chinese Language School 
    (2002-). </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Chen's general 
    research area is in Computational Electromagnetics and RF/Microwave Engineering 
    for communications and microelectronics. His current teaching and research 
    involvements are in the area computational electromagnetics and wireless communications 
    that include intelligent RF/microwave transceiving systems, smart antennas, 
    high-frequency electronics, and generic electromagnetic time-domain modeling. 
    He will continue to be involved in various university service and administrative 
    functions and professional and volunteer activities.</font></p>
