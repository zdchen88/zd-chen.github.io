<div align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, has 
  several research groups. This page belongs to one of these research groups: 
  RF/Microwave and Wireless Laboratory, oriented towards research in wireless 
  technology. </font></div>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prior 
  to March 31, 1997, the current Faculty of Engineering was known as the Technical 
  University of Nova Scotia, TUNS. On April 1, 1997, it merged with Dalhousie 
  University, both located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, becoming one larger institution.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  laboratory is under the supervision of Dr. Zhizhang (David) Chen, 
  Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</font></p>

  <font size="5">Objective and overview<br>
  </font><font size="3"><br>
  </font></font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general objectives of this research group is</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) to design innovative RF/microwave circuits/systems and antennas  for wireless communication, network  sensing and energy transfer applications and <br>
  (2) to research and investigate new electromagnetic phenomena and to develop novel electromagnetic materials, applications and modeling techniques (including bioelectricity, bioelectromagnetics)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More specifically, we are interested in projects and topics related to novel electromagnetic or optical materials/structures, analysis of digital and high-frequency signal integrity, and design of intelligent RF/microwave radio  systems, smart antennas, ultra-wide-band technology, high-frequency electronics  and wireless power transfer and harveting technology.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are looking for people who are motivated and have strong backgrounds in electrical, electronics, physics, computer, mathematics, computational science and programing to join us. At 
  the moment, we has several active research projects supported by the Natural 
  Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the corporate sector. 
  Although fundamental research is still part of our research activities (as it 
  renders us with long-term vitality), we are actively seeking more and larger 
  contract research projects from industry in the coming years. These opportunities 
  will allow us to continually contribute to the knowledge base and to aid to 
  the healthy development of our economy and technology.</font></p>
